## Technologies and Patterns Used

For technologies I used:
- Java 23
- Gradle
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web

And I augmented the clarity of changes with [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The types I use are:
- chore: any changes to build or other supporting aspects of the app;
- feat: new features;
- fix: for bug fixes.
